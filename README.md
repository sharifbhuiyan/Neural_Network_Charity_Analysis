## Overview of the project: 
<p align="justify">The purpose of the project to help Alphabet Soup foundation to predict where to make investments. To perform analysis on applicant datasets getting from foundation, a deep-learning neural networks model with the TensorFlow platform in Python has been created. <p>

<p align="justify">This project consists of four technical analysis deliverables. <p>

- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
- Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)
	

### Resources
- Data Source: [charity_data.csv](https://github.com/sharifbhuiyan/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/charity_data.csv)
- Software: Python 3.7 and accompanying Anaconda package, Conda 4.8.4, Jupyter Notebook

## Data Preprocessing:

## Summary:
- The balanced accuracy score is 93%. The high_risk precision is about 7% only with 91% sensitivity which makes a F1 of 14% only. Low_risk precision is almost 100% with a sensitivity of 94%.
